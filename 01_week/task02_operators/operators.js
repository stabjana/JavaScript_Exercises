/* 
- Create variables a and b, and assign them integer values.
- Use add, subtraction, multiply, divide, and modulus operator for a and b. Store each result in separate variables (sum, difference, product, quotient, remAinder).

- Use console.log() to print the results of each operation to the console.

- Add comments in your code to explain what each operation does. */
