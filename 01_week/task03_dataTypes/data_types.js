- Create a variable named hobbies and assign it an array containing a few string values (e.g., hobbies).

- Create an info object with two properties: schoolName (a string) and grade (an integer).

- Use console.log() to print each variable to the console.

- Use the typeof operator to check the data type of each variable and print the result using console.log(). */
